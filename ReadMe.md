An app that was created to allow students to register on our website so that they can provide ratings on universities and courses.
Users can also log in via twitter or github (we're developers after all :)).
Students can also leave comments which are sorted chronologically (by most recent).
There are some features that are missing which we would have implemented had we had enough time (e.g. allowing users to rate the helpfulness
of some comments, display a google map for each university location etc..)

A version of this website has been deployed here - 0808148w.pythonanywhere.com
